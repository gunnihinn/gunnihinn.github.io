wait for it to get cool enough to sleep. I’ve killed the mosquitos I’ve seen,
however, so until then I have only Haskell to keep me company.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>This morning, tef tweeted about
<a href=https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks/status/1155705690947805184>monads</a>,
which sent the Haskell pack his way with
barks of not getting it. Just now, pinboard was reminded of some guy’s rage
against
<a href=https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1156288764345348096>Esperanto</a>,
from back in the 90’s when the web was fun and mostly devoted
to things like explaining how "The Downward Spiral" is a concept album or
destroying Unix instead of each other’s mental health.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>For the Haskell pack, I did a PhD in the type of math that necessitates a lot of
category theory, and I have looked at your use of category theory, and judged it
to be unnecessary and pretentious and mainly focused on making you look smart
while being entirely trivial. But this is not that kind of blog post, one that
gets too tangled up in whether category theory is useful to get to the point.
(If nothing else,
<a href=https://jneem.github.io/merging/>Pijul</a>
proves that category theory is useful.) We’re here to discuss how Haskell as a
whole is nonsense if you’re not an academic. Our claim is that Haskell is a
useless language for writing software that has users.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Our point is simple, and focused on IO. We propose that you can measure how
user-facing a program or language is by measuring how much of its time it spends
or worries about doing IO. That is, after all, the medium through which anyone
who is not a program’s author (of which there may be many) will interact with
the program. The time spent doing IO can be on the command line, via a GUI, over
a network, or wherever; but to be a serious contender for user-facing programs,
a language has to make IO be easy.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>C is a terrible language for most new things today. Anyone writing new software
in C, that they expect to be used by other than thouroughly vetted people, needs
to be able to explain why they’ve chosen C. At the same time, a lot of us are
still exposed to C through the BSD or Linux kernels and syscalls, the undying
popularity of K&amp;R, random software on the internet, or other vectors. The
culture around C invented the modern language textbook, K&amp;R, and the modern
user-facing program, "Hello world", both of which spend most or all of their
time dealing with IO to talk to you or other users.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>I claim making IO as simple as possible, which C does for all its faults, to do
is analogous to trying to making it as simple as possible for other people to
talk to you in designed languages as you can.<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_1 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_1 title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>. Esperanto shows you can fail
at that goal, if you even had it, for it favors sounds native to European
languages above others. Likewise, Haskell shows you can fail at the goal of
making IO easy, if you even had it, for it does not.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Haskell is a purely functional, lazily evaluated language, with a type system.
Like tef explains, that is great, until you run into IO. Up until that point,
you could rearrange computations in any order you liked, if they needed to be
done at all. As soon as you need to do IO, though, you need something to happen
before another thing, which makes you very unhappy if you’re Haskell. It in fact
makes you so unhappy that you’ll drag the entire lost-at-sea community of
category theorists into the orbit of your language just so you can have an
abstraction for doing IO that fits into your model of the world. This
abstraction, monoids, then comes with the added benefit of being abstract enough
that all of your programmers can spend their time explaining it to each other
instead of writing programs that use the abstraction to do IO, and therefore
deal with any actual users.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Haskell is where programmers go to not have users.</p></div><div id=footnotes><hr><div class=footnote id=_footnotedef_1><a href=#_footnoteref_1>1</a>. One could say that what I mean is something more like making FFI as easy as possible, but that’s missing the point and would just move this discussion to some other, less inflammatory, level that we’re keen to avoid.</div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class=Footer><div class=u-wrapper><div class=u-padding>Copyright 2018-2020 :: Gunnar Þór Magnússon</div></div><script type=text/javascript src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script></footer></body></html>
