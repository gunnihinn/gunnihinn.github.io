It is for two or more players. The player with the fewest friends is the Infosec Expert; the other players are the Coworkers.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>To start, the Infosec Expert deals three cards face down from a standard deck of cards. The Coworker on the Infosec Expert’s right hand should draw one card.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>"Which card?" the Coworker may ask.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>"This is a simple phishing exercise," the Infosec Expert should reply. "Just pick a card."</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>"But they all look the same," the Coworker may object.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>"Draw one. And get it right."</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>This exchange should go on in increasingly hostile tones until the Coworker agrees to draw a card. It will have been the wrong card. The Infosec Expert should inform the Coworker:</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>"You got phished. You moron. You fucking idiot. You’re such a goddamn waste of space and time. How could you have gotten this so wrong? Were you even trying? Answer me. What the fuck was that?"</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Feel free to ad-lib along these lines, or draw as many cards as you want from the accompanying Admonishment Deck (expansion packs available). Include ad-hominem attacks and use as many personal details as you know. Interrupt the Coworker if they try to reply. Don’t hold back.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Once the Coworker is silent, the Infosec Expert should collect the cards, deal new ones, and proceed to the next Coworker in line.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The game ends with the Infosec Expert’s victory when all the Coworkers have left.</p></div></article></div></div></main><footer class=Footer><div class=u-wrapper><div class=u-padding>Copyright :: Gunnar Þór Magnússon</div></div><script type=text/javascript src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script></footer></body></html>
