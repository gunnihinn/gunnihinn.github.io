Every time I’ve tried restoring anything from those backups I’ve regretted it, because of course I just bought the drive, plugged it in and copied stuff to it, so it is a FAT32 drive while I have mostly had EXT4 filesystems, which means all my file permissions get lost during the process.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>I’ve written shameful little shell scripts to set file permissions to 0644 and directory permissions to 0755, recursively, many many times.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Part of my problem was that I both know just enough rsync to be dangerous and have a credit card so I can provision cloud VMs, so forever just around the corner was my perfect backup solution that I’d write myself and maintain and actually do instead of dealing with whatever I had going on in my life. I’ve come to accept that this will never happen, or perhaps more definitively, that I’d rather cut myself than write and maintain another piece of ad-hoc software for myself.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Luckily I recently found two things that have solved this whole problem for me: <a href=https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>borg</a> and <a href=https://www.rsync.net/>rsync.net</a>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Borg is backup software. It compresses and deduplicates data at the block level, and strongly encourages (but does not force) you to encrypt data before backing it up. It is everything I’d want from my half-assed rsync and shell script abomination.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>I read its documentation a couple of times and was impressed. I then set about comparing different VM hosts to see which one would give me the cheapest block storage option, when the result of some <a href=https://github.com/scotte/borgsnap>random google search</a> led me to rsync.net. They are a company that stores backups, pretty cheaply, and <a href=http://www.rsync.net/products/attic.html>even more cheaply</a> if you use borg to take them. I guess they just really love borg and want us to love it too.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>I signed up for their cheapest plan, which starts at 100GB stored for $18 per year. They have no network in- or egress costs, and the storage amount can be adjusted at any time. Once my account had been activated, I did a little password reset dance, and uploaded a public SSH key.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>I wanted to back up my <code>$HOME</code> directory, so after installing borg I ran:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre>export BORG_REMOTE_PATH=&#34;borg1&#34;
borg init --encryption repokey-blake2 UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>This created a remote borg repository called "home" on rsync.net’s servers. The environment variable is so we use a more recent version of borg on the remote server (version 1.1.11 at the time of writing), as the default version is rather old (version 0.29.0).</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>When choosing what encryption method to use, one can choose between a "repokey" or a "keyfile". They both create a private key locked with a passphrase; the difference is that with "repokey" the key is stored in the borg repo, while with "keyfile" it is stored outside of it. This boils down to whether we think a passphrase is enough security for our data, or whether we think having a secret keyfile is necessary. I figured my password manager could create a strong enough passphrase for my needs, and I didn’t want to think about losing the keyfile, so I chose "repokey-blake2".</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>To create my first backup, I ran</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre>borg create --exclude &#34;$HOME/.cache&#34; UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-1 &#34;$HOME&#34;</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>which created the archive "backup-1" in my "home" borg repository. I didn’t change the compression algorithm from the default one.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>By default borg compresses data with lz4. It can use other compression methods (xz, zlib, zstd). I compared their compression ratios on some binary files I had and found no difference between them. I think this is because the large binary files I have are mostly audio and video files in lossy formats, which don’t seem to benefit very much from further compression. I have a lot of text files as well, but text takes up so little relative space on today’s hardware that it makes no sense to spend CPU cycles on compressing it better than lz4 does.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>This backup command hummed along for a good while, and through a couple of reboot cycles. Doing a second backup right after it finished (or the day after) took a lot less time because of the deduplication:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre>borg create --exclude &#34;$HOME/.cache&#34; UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-2 &#34;$HOME&#34;</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>Restoring from backup is also easy:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre>borg extract UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-2</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>I set this up to run as a daily timed systemd service at noon (very easy on NixOS, which every Linux user should be using unless they hate themselves), and will never, ever think about this again. For a handful of bucks a year, that is a good deal.</p></div></article></div></div></main><footer class=Footer><div class=u-wrapper><div class=u-padding>Copyright :: Gunnar Þór Magnússon</div></div><script type=text/javascript src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script></footer></body></html>
