title: "About me"

---

I am a developer, mathematician, editor, and writer who lives in Amsterdam. I
grew up in Iceland, and have also lived in France and Mexico.

As a developer, I am interested in distributed systems, reliability and
debugging. I enjoy solving hard business problems through the use of computers,
rather than using computers for their own sake. I like to understand the domain
I work in, and to know and communicate with the stakeholders among my
coworkers.

As a mathematician, I am interested in complex differential geometry and its
applications to projective algebraic geometry. I'm also an amateur of linear
algebra, and prefer deep understanding of subjects to casual acquaintance.
I don't do a lot of research anymore, but keep meaning to finish a manuscript
on an interesting, but ultimately disappointing, cohomological approach to the
Riemannian geometry of the Kähler cones of compact manifolds.

== Curriculum vitae

=== Professional experience

2020&mdash;now::
Senior developer, http://www.booking.com[Booking.com].
I am working on the API modernization effort in the Accommodations Business Unit.
The project I've been running involves automatic conversion between legacy message formats and new ones on the edge of our network.
Its purpose is to enable developer velocity during the department's modernization efforts.

- Defined the project scope during conversations with leadership, chose technical tools, and wrote and deployed a reusable base upon which future work by different teams can be done.
- Collaborated with stakeholders across other teams to ensure the smooth adoption of the API adapters in a production environment.
- Delivered a working first implementation, complete with user and developer documentation that detail how a new instance of the project can be set up and the reasons behind technical choices.


2019::
Senior software engineer, https://www.independentview.nl/[Independent View].
Responsible for the operations and development of trading infrastructure at a
hedge fund. Working on Python, Java and Scala systems deployed on Windows.

- Ported existing codebase from Python 2 to 3 in time for the Python 2 end of
  life deadline.
- Setup continuous integration and test lifecycles of strategies to enable
  stable and correct deployments.
- Improved interactive trader system performance by orders of magnitude.

2018::
Senior developer, http://www.booking.com[Booking.com].
From May to December 2018, I was the lead developer on a team responsible for a
Golang-based Graphite frontend based on
https://www.github.com/go-graphite/carbonapi[carbonapi].

- Implemented basic infrastructure around the project; brought rollouts to
the company standard, defined monitoring and alerting, wrote operational
documents for on-call personnel, resolved an impasse that had blocked
rollouts for six months.
- Made numerous upstream contributions to open-source projects the company
used, including
https://www.github.com/gogo/protobuf[gogo/protobuf],
https://www.github.com/lomik/go-carbon[go-carbon], and
https://www.github.com/uber-go/zap[zap].
- Engaged in company-wide efforts to improve the resilience of services
across all teams. Reviewed internal outage postmortems, industry lessons,
and interviewed personnel to come up with a checklist that teams could use
to assess their own status and see where improvement was needed.

2016&mdash;2018::
Developer, http://www.booking.com[Booking.com].
Performed self-guided work in large existing code bases in Java, Golang, Perl
and Python as a member of both autonomous and Agile-based teams.

- Took ownership of the hotel search engine at Booking.com, a
business-critical highly available distributed system, after its authors
left the company. Communicated best-practices of its use to company users,
ensured its capacity through the year of 2017, and provided strategies for
future scaling of the system.
- Took on other non-classical developer responsibilities as needed, including
system administration at scale via Puppet and Salt, provisioning of new
hardware, setup of monitoring and alerting, and communication with other
teams and upper management in the absence of a product owner.
- Gave a series of talks whose aim was to educate other developers at the
company about our systems in the hope of making the boat go faster. Topics
included the Booking.com hotel search engine, memory use in Java, and
geometric interpretations of the average and standard deviations.

2015&mdash;2016::
Associate publisher, https://msp.org[Mathematical Sciences Publishers].
Responsible for the publication of the journals
https://msp.org/publications/journals/#gt[Geometry & Topology]
and
https://msp.org/publications/journals/#agt[Algebraic & Geometric Topology].
Also oversaw the edition and publication of Volume 18 of the conference series
https://msp.org/gtm/2012/18/[Geometry & Topology Monographs].
This work was done remotely.

- Stabilized the journal backlogs, making time-to-publication a known factor,
enabling better communication with authors.
- Wrote a linter of LaTeX documents customized for our editorial tasks, that
was adopted by other editors while still in the prototype stage, and
whose use lead to increased editor productivity.
- Analyzed hundreds of thousands of records in our publications to estimate
the value of building an in-house database of correctly formatted citations,
and then argued the ROI was too low to be worth it.
- Managed a team of remote copyeditors, ensuring quality through review and
feedback cycles.

2012&mdash;2015::
Copyeditor, https://msp.org[Mathematical Sciences Publishers].
Edited articles in world-known mathematical research journals like
https://msp.org/pjm/2018/295-2/[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]
and
https://msp.org/ant/about/cover/cover.html[Algebra & Number Theory].
Like other editors at the company, became an expert on TeX and LaTeX internals.
This work was done remotely.

- Top 10% performer among peer editors.
- Took over maintenance and extension of in-house editing software.
- Communicated with authors on final proof changes.

2009&mdash;2012::
Undergraduate lecturer, Université Joseph-Fourier.
Taught a course in linear algebra to first-year undergraduate students in
physics and mathematics. Responsible for one class of 30 students in a batch of
150 students. All classes, homework and communication were in French.

- Gave involved weekly homework assignments and provided detailed individual
feedback on improvement points, above what was required of teachers.
- Constructed a lecture plan from a list of topics a common final exam would
question students on.
- Wrote and graded mid-term exams in coordination with other teachers.
