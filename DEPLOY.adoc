= Deploy

Deploys happen like this:

- User on localhost creates a TAR archive with the new site
- User uploads TAR archive to remote
- Watcher on remote checks TAR for content hash
- When hash changes, it extracts the archive directory and does a symlink dance

Keep current hash in a file `current`.
